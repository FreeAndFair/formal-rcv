Formal RCV
==========

The purpose of this project is to make available formal specifications of
[ranked choice voting][rcv] (RCV) methods, i.e. variants of
[instant runoff voting][irv] (IRV) and the [single transferable vote][stv]
(STV).

The focus will initially be on those methods used in US jurisdictions.  The
project will use [Coq][coq].  The project will also aim to formalize ways
of auditing RCV elections.

This work will inform the work of IEEE's Voting System Standards Committee
Working Group [VSSC 1622.6][vssc_1622_6] "Voting Methods Mathematical Models."
