Glossary
========

This document provides definitions of a number of election and RCV-related
terms for the purposes of this project.  As much as possible, the names
of functions, variables, etc. in this project will be chosen to be
consistent with these definitions.

Note that the statutes of individual jurisdictions may assign different
meanings to these terms.  For example, San Francisco Charter
[Section 13.102(a)][SF_Charter_13_102_a] takes "ballot" to mean "vote"
in the sense of this glossary.  For this reason, the project strives to
distinguish visually when a term is being used with the global project
meaning as opposed to the the meaning as assigned by the statute being
discussed.
